# MusicMe
The inspiration and explanation behind this project can be found at [MusicMe](https://medium.com/@dgunther613/musicme-7fdb37a6fc97)

Created by: Daniel Gunther, Charlie Schmitt, and Clare Bradley

There are two separate aspects of our project, lyric generation and lyric examination.

To create figures and models for lyric generation:

-Download genre.json found in this repository

-Download song data from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edenbd/150k-lyrics-labeled-with-spotify-valence) - this file was too big to upload to this repository

-Dun the MusicMe Word Word Embeddings ipynb

Our model utilizes Google's Word2Vec word embedding model
